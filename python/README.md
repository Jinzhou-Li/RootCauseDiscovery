# Python code for RootCauseDiscovery

We used python 3.12.5 for running the python code. You need to have the following python packages installed: 
+ `numpy`
+ `scipy`
+ `random`
+ `sklearn`
+ `warnings`
+ `joblib`
+ `lingam`
+ `tqdm`

After these packages are installed, you can load the root cause discovery python codes located in `funcs` folder. 

## Example usage

See `Example.ipynb` for 2 simulated examples.
